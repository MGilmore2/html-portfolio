<h1>The Best Movies Acording to Maurice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>This movie was my first movie where a cartoon become live action, just before ironman!</p>
<h3>Batman Begins</h3>
<p>This movie added a different tone to Batman than I was used to, and brings good memories.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>An all time favorite, the newer ones leave a little to be desired for the Skywalker saga, but I enjoy the new cast!</p>
